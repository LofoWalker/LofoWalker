# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom Walker

Senior Software Engineer based in Paris 🇫🇷  
I design and build **robust backend systems**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture**, **scalability**, and **developer experience**.

A good developer doesn’t make themselves indispensable. They make the team autonomous.

---

## 🚀 What I do

- 🧱 Design **microservices architectures** (hexagonal / clean architecture)
- ⚙️ Build **backend APIs** with strong domain modeling
- 🤖 Work on **AI & LLM integrations** (API unification, DTO standardization)
- 🧪 Advocate for **testing, maintainability, and code quality**
- ☁️ Deploy and operate services in **production environments**

---

## 🛠 Tech stack

**Backend**
- Java / Kotlin
- Spring Boot, Quarkus
- REST APIs, event-driven systems

**Architecture & Quality**
- Hexagonal Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Testing strategies (unit, integration)

**DevOps & Infra**
- Docker, CI/CD
- Linux
- Observability & logging

**AI / LLM**
- OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Claude
- API abstraction & provider-agnostic models

---

## 📌 Featured projects

🔹 **FusionAI**  
Unified API to interact with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral, Claude…) behind a single interface.  
> Focus: abstraction, clean contracts, extensibility

🔹 **LLM Unified DTO**  
Standardized data models to normalize responses across LLM providers.  
> Focus: interoperability & maintainability

🔹 **Architecture & Craft projects**  
Hands-on experiments around hexagonal architecture, testing, and clean code practices.

## 📈 What I care about

- Clean, readable, and boring code 😄
- Long-term maintainability over short-term hacks
- Sharing knowledge and improving developer workflows
- Building systems that scale **technically and humanly**
- Being replacable is a good
