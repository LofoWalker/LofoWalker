# 👋 Hi, I'm Tom Walker

Senior Software Engineer based in Paris 🇫🇷  
I design and build **robust backend systems**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture**, **scalability**, and **developer experience**.

A good developer doesn’t make themselves indispensable. They make the team autonomous.

## 🚀 What I do

- 🧱 Design **microservices architectures** (hexagonal / clean architecture)
- ⚙️ Build **backend APIs** with strong domain modeling
- 🤖 Work on **AI & LLM integrations** (API unification, DTO standardization)
- 🧪 Advocate for **testing, maintainability, and code quality**
- ☁️ Deploy and operate services in **production environments**
